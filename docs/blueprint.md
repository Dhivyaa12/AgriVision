- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to provide a neutral, calming backdrop that evokes the soil.
- Accent color: Warm gold (#D4A27A) as an analogous color to highlight key actions, calls to action, and important data, providing a touch of richness and value.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, combining a modern look and a little warmth or personality; suitable for body text. Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif similar to Didot with high contrast thin-thick lines, lending an elegant feel for headings.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different crops, diseases, and government schemes. The icons should be easily recognizable and consistent with the overall earthy aesthetic.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to present information in an organized and accessible manner. The dashboard should offer a clear overview of all features, with intuitive navigation.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the interface. For example, smoothly transition when switching between modules or updating data.
